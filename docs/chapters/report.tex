\chapter{Problem description}
To get a preliminary estimation of an airfoil's performance, numerical methods
can be used which represent the airfoil as a series of flat, zero-thickness,
panels. Various kinds of singularities can then be placed on those panels to
manipulated the airflow around them to resemble the flow behavior around the
actual airfoil.\\

In this part of the report, two separate methods will be discussed.
The first method ignores the airfoil's thickness and instead reduces it to only
a set of $n$ panels located on the camber line. A lumped vortex element is then
placed at some location on each panel, as well as a collocation point. At each
collocation point, the influence of all these vortex elements will be evaluated.
From this, values like $C_l$, $C_m$ and $C_P$ can be estimated. Using this
method the effect of camber on the airfoil can be quickly evaluated.\\

To also evaluated the effect of thickness, the second method instead places $n$
panels along the airfoil's surface. This time constant vortex elements are
placed in the panels.
Both methods are based on the Kutta condition, meaning this condition is
intrinsically satisfied. Both methods have the same general structure, which can
be seen in \autoref{fig:flow_diagram}. The steps are discussed in more detail
for each of the two methods in the following sections.

\section{Geometry Definition}
Before we can begin the analysis, the functions describing the desired airfoil's
camber line, and upper and lower surface should be created. Airfoils are defined
using the NACA 4-digit code. \autoref{eq:camber} is used to obtain the camber
line function.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:camber}
    y_{c}=\left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            \frac{m}{p^{2}}\left(2 p\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)-\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^{2}\right),
            & 0 \leq x \leq p c \\
            \frac{m}{(1-p)^{2}}\left((1-2 p)+2 p\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)-\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^{2}\right),
            & p c \leq x \leq c
        \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\medskip

Here $m$ is the maximum camber and $P$ is the location of the maximum camber, or
the first and second digit of the 4-digit NACA code divided by ten respectively.
Subsequently, to find the coordinates of the the upper and lower airfoil
surface, the thickness is applied perpendicular to the camber line using
\autoref{eq:coor_u} and \autoref{eq:coor_l} respectively, where $\theta =
\arctan\left( \frac{y_c}{dx}\right)$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coor_u}
    \left(\begin{array}{l} x_U, \: y_U\end{array}\right) =
    \left(\begin{array}{l} x-y_t \sin \theta, \: y_c+y_t\cos \theta\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coor_l}
    \left(\begin{array}{l} x_L, \:  y_L\end{array}\right) =
    \left(\begin{array}{l} x+y_t \sin \theta, \: y_c-y_ t \cos \theta\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}

\chapter{Panel Methods}  % TODO Decide if this should be a section?
Two different methods well be implemented to peform basic airfoil analysis.
First, the airfoil is represented by its camberline only, and thus has a
thickness of zero. The results of this method will be compared with the second
method, which discritizes the airfoil by placing panels on the outer surface
instead. Hence this second method does take airfoil thickness into account.

\section{Lumped Vortex Method}
\label{sec:thin}
The first method, described by \citeauthor{katz_plotkin}\cite{katz_plotkin}, analyzes an airfoil
looking only at the airfoil's camber line. This discritization is visualized in
\autoref{fig:discr_thin}, where $n=7$ panels are placed on the camber line starting at
the leading edge. These panels are created by adding $n+1$ nodes on the camber
line, the coordinates for which are obtained using the camber line function from
\autoref{eq:camber}. Lumped vortex elements and collocation points are placed at
25\% and 75\% of each panel's length. This way the airfoil is represented as a
set of zero-thickness vortex sheets. Not that linear node spacing is used in
\autoref{fig:discr_thin}. For the implementation, however, cosine spacing is used to
increase accuracy of the results at the leading and trailing edge.


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{static/disc_camber.png}
\caption{Discritization of the airfoil camber line using $n=7$ flat panels\cite{katz_plotkin}}
\label{fig:discr_thin}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Equations}
The normal velocity, which consists of the free-stream velocity and the
self-induced velocity, must be zero at each point along the camber line. This
way the camber line is set to be a streamline of the free-stream. This
boundary condition is described by \autoref{eq:thin_cond}. Here,
$\vec{\bf{n}}_i$ is the normal vector of the $i-$th panel given by
\autoref{eq:normal}, and $\alpha_i$ is the angle w.r.t. the x-axis of the $i-$th
panel.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thin_cond}
    \left( u_i, \: w_i \right) \cdot \vec{\bf{n}}_i + \left( U_\infty,
    \: W_\infty \right) \cdot  \vec{\bf{n}}_i = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:normal}
    \vec{\bf{n}}_i = \left( \sin \alpha_i, \: \cos \alpha_i \right)
\end{equation}

Next, if $\left( x_i, \: y_i \right)$ is the location of the $i-$th panel
collocation point, and $\left( x_j, \: y_j \right)$ is the location of the
$j-$th vortex element, the velocity induced at each collocation point due to the
presence of the $n$ vortices, with strength $\Gamma_j$, is found using
\autoref{eq:v_ind_thin}.
\medskip

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:v_ind_thin}
    \left(\begin{array}{l}
    u_i \\ w_i
    \end{array}\right)
    =
    \sum_{j=1}^{n} \:
    \left[ \frac{\Gamma_{j}}{2 \pi r_{i,j}^{2}}
    \left(\begin{array}{cc}
    0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0
    \end{array}\right)
    \left(\begin{array}{l}
    x_i-x_{j} \\ z_i-z_{j}
    \end{array}\right) \right], \; \; \; \; \; \forall \; i \in \{1,...,n\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}r_{j}^{2}=\left(x_i-x_j\right)^{2}+\left(z_i-z_j\right)^{2}\end{equation}
\medskip

Naturally, if $i=j$, the respective collocation point and vortex are located
on the same panel. The vorticities, $\Gamma_j$, are the unknown which will be solved for.
Combining \autoref{eq:v_ind_thin} with \autoref{eq:thin_cond}, and moving the free-stream
velocity from \autoref{eq:thin_cond} to the right hand side of the equation,  yields a
system of $n$ equations which can be solved algebraically to find the vorticity of each vortex element.
Once the vorticity $\Gamma_j$ is know for each vortex element, the change in lift and
pressure are obtained using \autoref{eq:thin_lift} and \autoref{eq:thin_press} respectively.
 $s_i$ is the length of the $i-$th panel.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thin_lift}
\Delta L_i = \rho v_\infty \Gamma_{j=i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thin_press}
\Delta P_i = \rho v_\infty \frac{\Gamma_{j=i}}{s_i}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Verification}
The results of the zero-thickness camberline panel method are verified by
comparison with example data from \citeauthor{katz_plotkin} for an elliptical
camberline with a maximum camber of $0.1$. Since Naca 4-digit airfoils are
limited to a maximum camber of $0.09$, the Naca 9501 is used to approximate that
same airfoil. Both the reference plot and obtained plot are shown in \autoref{fig:verif_thin}.

\section{Panelled Airfoil Surface}
\label{sec:thick}
The second method, described by \citeauthor{katz_plotkin}\cite{katz_plotkin},
and \citeauthor{kuethe_chow_1998}\cite{kuethe_chow_1998}, places constant vortex
elements on in the center of panels on the airfoils surface. The airfoil is
discritized by placing $n$ nodes on the airfoil starting at the trailing edge,
over the lower airfoil surface to the leading edge and back to the trailing edge
over the upper surface. Each node presents a panel edge, so there are $n$
panels. The same naming scheme as used in \autoref{sec:thin} applies here too.
Note that the method is explained using the equations from
\citeauthor{katz_plotkin}\cite{katz_plotkin}, as it is easier to see what they
represent than the version from
\citeauthor{kuethe_chow_1998}\cite{kuethe_chow_1998}, which breaks everything
down in coefficients. The code, however, implements the coefficient equations
from \citeauthor{kuethe_chow_1998}\cite{kuethe_chow_1998} as they are slightly
easier to implement.


\subsection{Equations}
\label{ssec:eq_thick}
The boundary condition in this case states that the inner tangential velocity
must be zero, as described by \autoref{eq:thick_cond}\cite{katz_plotkin}.
Naturally there can be no airflow inside the airfoil itself. Alternatively, also
the zero normal flow boundary condition could here be used again
\cite{kuethe_chow_1998}. The Kutta-condition, shown in \autoref{eq:kutta}, is
added to ensure smooth flow transition to freestream at the trailing adge.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thick_cond}
    \left( U_\infty + u_i, \: W_\infty + w_i \right) \cdot \left( \cos \alpha_i,
    \: -\sin \alpha_i \right) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kutta}
      \gamma_1 + \gamma_{n} = 0
\end{equation}

The induced velocity, $\gamma_j$, in a collocation point at $(x_i,\: y_i)$ due
to $n$ vortices located at $(x_j, \: y_j)$ is obtained using
\autoref{eq:v_ind_thick}. Here $(x_j, \: y_j)$ is also the panel's leading edge
node, so $(x_{j+1}, \: y_{j+1})$ refer to the panel's trailing edge node.
Substituting \autoref{eq:v_ind_thick} in \autoref{eq:thick_cond} and applying it
to every collocation point present will yield a system of $n$ equations which
can be solved for the vorticities $\gamma_j$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:v_ind_thick}
    \left(\begin{array}{l}
    u_{p_i} \\ w_{p_i}
    \end{array}\right)
    =
    \sum_{j=1}^{n} \:
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \frac{\gamma_j}{2\pi}\left[ \tan^{-1} \left(
        \frac{z_i - z_{j+1}}{x_i - x_{j+1}}\right)
         - \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{z_i - z_j}{x_i - x_j}\right) \right] \\[1em]
    -\frac{\gamma_j}{4\pi} \ln \left[ \frac{\left( x_i - x_j \right)^2 +
    \left( z_i - z_j \right)^2}{\left( x_i - x_{j+1}\right)^2 +
    \left( z_i - z_{j+1} \right)^2 }  \right]
    \end{array}\right), \; \; \; \; \; \forall \; i \in \{1,...,n\}
\end{equation}
\medskip

Once that the results of \autoref{eq:v_ind_thick} are in the local panel
coordinate system and must be transformed back to the global one. Adding
\autoref{eq:kutta} to the system of equations obtained from
\autoref{eq:v_ind_thick}, will result in n+1 equations.
\citeauthor{katz_plotkin}\cite{katz_plotkin} deals with this by replacing an
arbetrary equation from the system with the Kutta condition, while
\citeauthor{kuethe_chow_1998}\cite{kuethe_chow_1998} adds an equation, where the
Kutta condition is altered as shown in \autoref{eq:kutta2}. Either way results
in again an equal amount of equations and unknowns.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kutta2}
      \gamma_1 + \gamma_{n+1} = 0
  \end{equation}

Once the vorticity $\gamma_j$ is know for each vortex element, the change in
lift and pressure are obtained using \autoref{eq:thick_lift} and
\autoref{eq:thick_press} respectively.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thick_lift}
\Delta L_i = \rho v_\infty \gamma_{j=i} s_j
\end{equation}
\medskip
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thick_press}
\Delta Cp = 1 - \left( \cos{\alpha+\alpha_i} + \frac{ \gamma_{j=i} }{ 2 v_\infty } \right)
\end{equation}
\medskip

To facilitate the implementation of \autoref{eq:v_ind_thick}, the coefficient
breakdown version by \citeauthor{kuethe_chow_1998} was used in the actual code
for this problem.

\subsection{verification}
The constant vortex method with panelled airfoil surface is validated with data
obtained from XFOIL\cite{xfoil}. The pressure distribution found for the
NACA4412 airfoil is shown in \autoref{fig:thick_verif}.
\autoref{fig:thick_verif1} and \autoref{fig:thick_verif2} show the results for
the NACA4412 at 0 and 10 degrees angle of attack respectively. It can be seen
that the results coincide almost perfectly, the only exception being at zero
angle of attack, where the calculated pressure coefficient near the leading edge
on the bottom surface is slightly higher compared to the reference data. A
second verification was performed, results from which are plotted in
\autoref{fig:thick_verif3}, his time using the NACA0012 airfoil. Again, the
only descripencies are at the leading edge, where the program slightly
underestimates the underpressure on the top surface. Note that
\autoref{fig:thick_verif4} shows the pressure distribution over the NACA0012
airfoil at 3 degrees angle of attack (instead of zero degrees like in
\autoref{fig:thick_verif1}), since the symmetric airfoil at zero angle of attack
has equal pressure on top and bottom surfaces, resulting in a simple line plot.

    \label{fig:thick_verif3}
\end{figure}

Looking at the resulting estimation for $C_l$, shown in \autoref{tab:cl_thick},
it can be seen that the calculated values for the lift coefficient are slightly
below the values returned by XFOIL. For the NACA0012, the relative error
$\epsilon$ is zero for $\alpha=0$, and increases with angle of attack. When
$\alpha=10\deg$, the error has risen to $\epsilon=-3.51\%$ (the minus indication
the obtained values is lower than the one returned by XFOIL). The same is true
for the NACA4412 results, where the errro $\epsilon$ is lowest when $\alpha$ is
zero, and increases with increasing angle of attack. The value of the error si
lower, however, than for the symmetrical airfoil, having a value of
$\epsilon=-2.07\%$ at $\alpha=10\deg$. These results are also shown as plots in \autoref{fig:cl_thick}

\chapter{Analysis}
Now that the program is validated, the different aspects of airfoils can be
looked at. First, the effect of camber is discussed in \autoref{sec:camber}.
Next, the change in results due to varying panel thickness is evaluated in
\autoref{sec:thickness}, and, finally, the effect of panel density on the
obtained results is checked in \autoref{sec:panels}.

\section{Effect of Camber}
\label{sec:camber}
To see the effect of varying camber on the results, both the panelled
comaberline and panelled surface methods will be used on airfoils a set of
airfoils (see \autoref{fig:camber}) where the only the camber value is
different. The first one, NACA0012, is a symmetrical airfoil and thus has zero
camber. Subsequent airfoils NACA2412, NACA4412, and NACA9412 have a respective
maximum camber of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.9 at $\frac{x}{c}=0.4$. \autoref{fig:camber1}
plot these airfoils' pressure distributions for $\alpha=3$, and
\autoref{fig:camber2} does the same for $\alpha=8$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
      \centering
      \captionsetup{width=.8\linewidth}
      \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{static/camber_a3.png}
      \caption{\centering Pressure distributions with varying camber at $\alpha = 3^{\circ}$}

      \label{fig:camber2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{\centering Plots showing the effect of camber on the pressure distribution}
    \label{fig:camber}
\end{figure}

Clearly, a higher camber value leads to higher local values for the pressure
coefficient. This means the plotted lines representing the $C_p$ of the upper
and lower surfaces lie further appart. This increase in pressure difference in
turn results in a higher value for the lift coefficients. The increase of $C_P$
with camber is not linear. It can be seen that at high values for camber, the
increase of pressure coefficients with camber is higher than for low camber.

The same is true for $C_l$, as shown in \autoref{fig:cambercl}. For different
angles of attack, the $C_l$ is plotted as a function of camber for two airfoil
series: \autoref{fig:cambercl1} shows the $C_l$ variations for NACA4X12, where X
is the camber value$x10$, and \autoref{fig:cambercl2} shows the $C_l$ variations
for NACA2X22. Angle of attack clearly has no effect on how much the camber
increases the lift coefficient, as the lines of different values for $\alpha$
ahave equal gradients for every camber value.

\section{Effect of Airfoil Thickness}
\label{sec:thickness}

For the lumped vortex method, with a panelled camberline, as discussed in
\autoref{sec:thin}, the thickness will not have any effect on the results. This
method only looks at the camberline, and ignores the airfoil's thickness.
Instead, only the constant vortex method with panelled airfoil surfaces from
\autoref{sec:thick} can be used for this. Again, results for symmetric
(NACA00XX) and cambered airfoils (NACA44XX) are plotted in
\autoref{fig:thickcp1} and \autoref{fig:thickcp2} respectively. The angle of
attack is constant for all cases: $\alpha = 5^{\circ}$. The pressure
distributions show that an increase in thickness reduces the suction peak on the
leading edge, while increasing the pressure deferential over the rest of the
airfoil, leading to a net increase in lift. This is confirmed by looking at the
change of $C_l$ with increasing thicness, shown in \autoref{fig:thickcl}.
Comparing the results for a symmetric airfoil (\autoref{fig:thickcl1}) with
those for a cambered airfoil (\autoref{fig:thickcl2}), shows that the increase
in lift for a cambered airfoil is greater than for a symmetric airfoil if the
thickness is increased. This can be seen by the slightly larger gradients in
\autoref{fig:thickcl2}, compared to \autoref{fig:thickcl1}.

\section{Effect of Panel Density}
\label{sec:panels}
Varying the panel density of course will also vary the fidelity of the analysis.
\autoref{fig:thick_panels} shows the effect of increasing the amount of panels
on $C_l$ (with $\alpha = 5^{\circ}$), for a symmetric (\autoref{fig:thick_panels1}) and a cambered
(\autoref{fig:thick_panels2}) airfoil. The choice was made to consider values
with a relative error lower than 0.5\%, compared to values from XFOIL, are
adequate. To satisfy this requirement, 98 panels are needed for the symmetric
airfoil and 102 are required for the cambered airfoil. From this it can be
concluded that, to obtain adequately accurate values, at no less than 100 panels
should be used at all times.
