    """Calculates vortex induced velocity influence coefficient matrix.

    This is meant to be used with the :py:class:`ConstantVortex` panel
    method which assumes that each panel has a bound constant strength
    vortex element of unknown circulation per unit length, gamma. The
    collocation points are at the midpoint of each panel.

    The influence coefficient matrix represents the influence of all
    vortices, index `j`, on all collocation points, index `i`. Initially
    a circulation strength of gamma = 1 is assumed to obtain the
    geometric influence of a vortex on the current panel. Then
    the induced velocity due to vortex `j` on collocation point `i` is
    calculated with :py:func`vortex_c_2d` function.

    The result is then projected onto the normal and tangent vectors of
    the current panel `i`. This results in two coefficient matrices
    where, the matrix created with the normal vector is required to
    solve for the unknown circulation strengths using the zero-normal
    velocity boundary condition. On the other hand, the matrix created
    with the tangent vector is necessary to calculate the tangent
    velocity at each panel which is required to calculate the
    pressure coefficient.

    Args:
        start_pts: Start nodes (points) of all panels
        end_pts: End nodes (points) of all panels
        col_pts: Collocation points placed at the midpoint of each panel
        panel_angles: Panel angles in SI radian as a column vector
        panel_normals: Panel normal vectors as a set of row vectors
        panel_tangents: Panel tangent vectors as a set of row vectors

    Returns:
        Vortex influence matrix with assumed circulation, gamma = 1. The
        shape of the influence matrix is (2, n_panels, n_panels) since
        for the Constant Strength Vortex method, both the normal and
        tangent induced velocity influence coefficients are required.
        Therefore, index 0 and 1 of the returned matrix correspond to
        the normal and tangent coefficient matrix respectively.
